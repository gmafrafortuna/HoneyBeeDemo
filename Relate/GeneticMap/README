Genetic Maps
Generation of genetic maps for RFMIX analysis using crossover data generated by Liu et al. (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0566-0 Additional File 4).

Crossover positions were liftover from Amel_4.5 to Amel_HAv3.1 using NCBI's remapping service (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap)
Complete genetic maps are created with the create-geneticMaps.R script with the remmaped crossover data in remapped_Liu_crossovers_NCBI.txt
The genetic maps are used to create VCF specific genetic maps using the vcf2geneticMap.sh and vcf2geneticMap.R scripts
